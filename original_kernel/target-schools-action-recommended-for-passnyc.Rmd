## 1. Executive Summary
The specialized high schools (SPHS) of New York City have a long history of meeting the educational need of students with strong academic performance. As these prestigious high schools have witnessed a shift toward to a more homogeneous student body, they are facing mounting criticism against their lack of gender, racial and socioeconomic diversity. 

Although individual students’ propensity to apply and their likelihood to be admitted by the ultracompetitive SPHS are susceptible to personal preferences as well as previous academic standing, research suggests that students may be influenced by the so-called “middle school effect” too [1]. For instance, students from middle schools where test preparation resources are readily available and many students have been admitted to SPHS previously may be more likely to apply for SPHS. Differences between middle schools suggest potential opportunities for intervention to improve access to SPHS for underrepresented groups.

Using school-level data, this analysis aims to provide actionable insight to PASSNYC, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to increasing diversity in students applying for and receiving placements at SPHS.

Instead of training models based on data that encodes existing ethnic, gender and cultural bias, this analysis will focus on exploratory analysis and unsupervised learning. __As illustrated in the Venn diagram, this analysis will look at two separate aspects, demographic composition and academic performance, of middle schools, and address two major questions:__

1) __Demographic composition: which middle schools have students historically underrepresented at SPHS?__
2) __Academic performance: which middle schools have students academically qualified for SPHS and therefore more likely to be motivated and apply for SPHS?__

The intersection of these two sets of middle schools represent target schools that can benefit the most from services and resources provided by PASSNYC and its partners. This analysis recommends PASSNYC to:

1) __Introduce on-campus intervention at 5 middle schools__
2) __Launch awareness campaign at 48 middle schools__
3) __Organize regional information sessions and workshops at 3 locations__

## 2. Which public middle schools are more likely to have students underrepresented at SPHS?
The specialized high schools of New York City are facing mounting criticism for their lack of gender, racial and socioeconomic diversity. In "Pathways to an Elite Education," Corcoran and Baker-Smith use sequential logistic models to identify group differences across touch points throughout the SPHS application pipeline. They concludes that four social groups are underrepresented in application, admission and matriculation process: __Black, Hispanic, female and low-income students__ [1].

Using school-level demographic data, this section focuses on the diversity issue at SPHS and aims to answer two questions:\n

1) __Are "feeder schools," which account for the majority of SPHS offers, compositionally different from other schools?__
2) __Students from which public schools are most likely to be underrepresented in the application process?__

***

### 2.1 Compositional difference between feeder and non-feeder schools
In a typical year, around 25,000 students take SHSAT and apply for SPHS, accounting for 1/3 of total eight graders in New York City. However, offers are not distributed equally among students from different middle schools. In 2018, top 10 middle schools with the most students admitted to SPHS represent 25% of total offers [2].

To examine whether these feeder schools where offers concentrate are compositionally different from other schools, the following density plots illustrate the distribution of three metrics: % female students, % Black and Hispanic students, and Economic Need Index (calculated as % temp housing + % HRA eligible * 0.5 + % free lunch eligible * 0.5).

Figure 1 illustrates that the gender ratio of feeder schools and non-feeder schools display __similar distribution centered at 49%.__ Despite of the gender gap observed in different touch points across the application funnel, similarity in gender ratio across schools make it difficult to study the middle school impact using school-level data alone.

On the other hand, Figure 2 and Figure 3 show that __feeder schools and non-feeder schools are strikingly different in terms of their racial composition and economic need level. Not only are Asian, Caucasian and high-income students more likely to attend SPHS, but also students from middle schools with higher proportion of Asian and Caucasian students and lower economic need.__

These compositional differences and the widespread distribution of the last two metrics reflect the income and racial segregation that stem from social prejudice as well as discriminatory policies; characterize the public school system of New York City; and perpetuates the division of the society. In the following section, the last two metrics will be use to calculate a scaled score to measure how likely students from a given middle school will be underrepresented at SPHS.

### 2.2 Underrepresentation Score
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.align="center", warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = diversity_tbl %>% 
         mutate(count_of_offers = ifelse(is.na(count_of_offers), 0, count_of_offers)),

  guides(fill = FALSE, alpha = FALSE, size = FALSE,
         color = guide_legend(nrow = 2)) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 11),
        legend.position = "top",
        legend.text = element_text(size = 11),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(color = "white", fill = "white"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "#EFEFEF"),

        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 11))

diversity_cor <- cor.test(diversity_tbl$economic_need_index,
                          diversity_tbl$percent_black_hispanic, 
                          method = "pearson",
                          conf.level = 0.95)
```
The scatterplot above visualizes the positive correlation (r = 0.77, p < 0.01) between Economic Need Index and % Black and Hispanic students. Feeder schools with more students admitted to SPHS (<font color="#53c7f0">__larger-sized blue points__</font>) tend to have low-to-medium economic need and lower proportion of Black or Hispanic students, while a noticeable number of non-feeder schools (<font color="#707070">__gray points__</font>) cluster around the upper right corner of the plot. In other words, students from these non-feeder schools are mostly low-income Hispanic or Black student that are underrepresented at SPHS.

To better evaluate the need of students at different schools and help PASSNYC prioritize its outreach effort, __a simple index score, the Underrepresentation Score, will be assigned to each middle school to quantify how likely students at a given school are underperforming during SPHS application process__ As the origin in the plot represents middle school without Hispanic, Black and low-income student. __The Underrepresentation Score is calculated as the scaled Euclidean distance between a given point and the origin with range from 0 to 1.__

> <font size = "3">__Underrepresentation Score = Scaled Euclidean distance between a given point and the origin__</br>

Underrepresentation Score closer to 1 indicates high level of underrepresentation at SPHS. Please see Table 1 in the appendix for the full list of middle schools with their corresponding Underrepresentation Scores. 

***

### 2.3 Middle schools with the highest underrepresentation scores
To help PASSNYC achieve greater impact, it is important to identify which middle schools that are most likely to be underrepresented at SPHS and allocate PASSNYC's resources accordingly. __As a result, the rest of analysis will focus on top 25% middle schools with the highest Underrepresentation Score, which account for 121 out of 482 middle schools with demographic data available.__  Please note that none of these 121 schools have more than 5 students admitted to SPHS in 2018.

The following table lists information about these 121 schools sorted in descending order of their Underrepresentation Score. Please see appendix for the full list of middle schools with their corresponding Underrepresentation Scores. 

<center><h4>Top 25% Middle Schools with the Highest Underrepresentation Scores</h4></center>

col_name <- c("Rank", "DBN", "District", "School Name", "% Black and Hispanic", 
              "Economic Need Index", "Diversity Score")

diversity_tbl %>%
  filter(top_deciles == 1) %>%
  mutate(row = row_number(desc(diversity_score)),
         feeder_school = ifelse(feeder_school, "Feeder School", "Non-feeder School")) %>%
  transmute(row, schooldbn, district, school_name, 
            percent_black_hispanic = as.character(percent_black*100, "%"), 
            economic_need_index,

```

Top 25% schools with the highest Underrepresentation Scores represent 20 out of 32 school districts in New York City, and districts with higher index scores tend to have higher proportion of underrepresented middle schools.

## 3. Which public middle schools are more likely to have students qualified for SPHS?
The SPHS of New York City have a long history of supporting the educational needs of students with strong academic or artistic performance. Eight out of nine SPHS admit students based on a single entrance exam, SHSAT. As the sore means of admission to the city's most prestigious high schools, SHSAT tests for students' abilities in English and Math. __Assuming that students from middle schools with stronger academic performance are more likely to be motivated to apply and be admitted to SPHS, this section will focus on academic performance, and aims to answer one question through k-means clustering: which non-feeder schools have education quality and academic performance similar to those of feeder schools?__


***

### 3.1 K-means clustering and features used
K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions existing observation into k clusters based on each observation's distance to cluster mean (See Wiki for detailed explanation: wikipedia.org/wiki/k-means_clustering).

As previous section concludes that feeder schools are compositionally different from non-feeder schools, in this section k-mean algorithm will be deployed to examine the following non-demographic features to identify non-feeder schools that are _academically instead of demographically_ similar to feeder schools.\n

1) New York State annual test results:</br>
-% of eighth graders received L1, L2, L3, L4 in Math and ELA tests respectively</br>
-Average scale score of Math and ELA tests</br>

2) New York City Department of Education annual quality review:</br>
-Measure of rigorous instruction</br>
-Measure of collaborative teachers</br>
-Measure of supportive environment</br>
-Measure of effective school leadership</br>
-Measure of strong family community ties</br>
-Measure of trust</br>

3) Other:</br>
-Average student attendance rate</br>
-Average chronical absence rate</br>
-Pupil to teacher ratio</br>
-Average class size</br>


***

### 3.2 K-Means Clusters
Elbow method based on within-cluster sum of squares determines that the optimal number of cluster is 3. Using 20 features listed above, k-means algorithm partitions 472 middle schools with non-demographic data available into 3 clusters with different levels of academic performance as shown in the following scatterplot.

<font color = "black">Among clusters identified, over 60% of middle schools in Cluster A are feeder schools with more than 5 students accepted by SPHS in 2018. Cluster A also has the highest mean scores in state-wide ELA and Math exams, two of the strongest predictors for students' performance in SHSAT [1]. As each middle school with data available has been assigned to one cluster based on non-demographic feature, the cluster label will be used to infer how likely a given middle school has students qualified for SPHS:</font>

## 4. Recommendations to PASSNYC
Of all middle schools in top quantile of the Underrepresentation Score, 119 middle schools have non-demographic data available and thereby assigned to one of the three k-means clusters as shown in the following plots. __Of 119 schools, 53 are assigned to Cluster A and B, indicating high level of education quality and academic potential. Students from these middle schools are more like to be qualified for and therefore be motivated to apply for SPHS, and should take higher priority in PASSNYC's outreach effort.__

### 4.1 Recommendation 1: On-campus intervention at 5 schools in Cluster A

As introduced in Section 3, Cluster A represents middle schools that are most likely to have students qualified for SPHS. Of all middle schools in the top quantile of the Underrepresentation Score, 5 schools are listed below are assigned to Cluster A, but none of them have more than 5 students accepted by SPHS in 2018. Students from these schools are likely to benefit the most from services provided by PASSNYC and its partners, and these schools should take the highest priority in PASSNYC's plan. As a result, on-campus intervention at these middle schools are recommended:

1) Awareness: Organize on-campus information session to engage parents and students in learning about SHSAT and SPHS;
2) Participation: Assign one volunteer to each of the five schools to answer questions from parents and students and assist them with the application process;
3) Preparation: Recruit and match students from these five schools to test preparation resources provided by PASSNYC's partners; organize on-campus test preparation workshops or tutoring sessions;

  transmute(dbn, district, school_name, diversity_score = round(diversity_score, digits = 2),
         mean_scale_score_ela, mean_scale_score_math) %>%

                               autoWidth = TRUE))
```

### 4.2 Recommendation 2: Awareness campaign at 48 schools in Cluster B

The following action items is recommendated to PASSNYC to boost awareness about SHSAT and SPHS at 48 middle schools in Cluster B: 

1) Awareness: Launch awarenss campaign at 48 schools in Cluster B through distributing informational flyers or sending physical mails or emails to teachers, parents and students;

<center><font size = "3">48 Underrepresented Schools in <font color = "#1f3e5a">Cluster B</font></font></center>

         cluster_name == "B") %>%
  transmute(dbn, district, school_name, diversity_score = round(diversity_score, digits = 2), 
         mean_scale_score_ela, mean_scale_score_math) %>%
  arrange(desc(diversity_score)) %>%
  rename_all(~col_name) %>%
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE,

### 4.3 Recommendation 3: Regional information sessions and workshops at 3 locations for all schools

The interactive map visualizes the locations of public middle schools in New York City. It shows that middle schools in top 25% of the Underrepresentation Score cluster around three locations: Harlem, Bronx and Brooklyn (Braodway Junction), neighborhoods with high proportion of Black and Hispanic residents. These geographic clusters again reflects the residential segragation shaped by the _de jure_ segragation from last century and its depressed impact on education and household income. Targeting these geographic clusters, PASSNYC can consider the following options:

1) Awareness: Organize regional information sessions in Harlem, Bronx and Brooklyn (Broadway Junction) to boost awareness of SHSAT and SPHS
2) Participation: Assign one volunteer to each neighborhood to direct parents and students to resources available
3) Preparation: Organize regional test preparation workshops in neighborhoods mentioned above

### 6.2 Intervention needed for Cluster C
Recommendations described in Section 5 focus on middle schools in Cluster A and B, which have better academic standing and higher education quality. Cluster C, left out in the recommendation, in fact represents the majority of underrepresented students in New York City, and has the highest economic and educational need among all clusters. Given that PASSNYC aims at promoting diversity of students taking SHSAT and receiving placements at SPHS, middle schools in Cluster C are not recommended as target schools for PASSNYC. Underperforming students at these schools can benefit more from intervention on an earlier stage to improve overall academic performance comparing to services and resources provided by PASSNYC and its partners.
